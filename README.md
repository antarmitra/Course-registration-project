## Question No - 2
-> My assignment project discussed how I managed the state

Managing state in React is a fundamental concept because it allows your application to keep track of data that can change over time. React provides a built-in feature called "state" to manage and update this data.

To use state in a React component, i typically start by initializing it in the component's constructor or using the useState hook (if i're using functional components).

I defined the handleAddToCart function to handle the addition of course to the add state array

I first check whether the selected course already exist in the add card, then added this card 

If the course is already selected i calculate the new crediHour remaining and totalPrice based on the select course information

The function updates the state when the button is clicked. Remember that state management is an essential concept in React, and understanding how to properly manage and update state is crucial to building functional and maintainable applications.
